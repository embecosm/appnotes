    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      As part of its commitment to the free and open source engineering
      community, &embecosm; visits schools, community groups and hobbyist
      converences, running courses to introduce people to the wonders of
      electronics. These courses are largely based on simple &arduino; like
      processors.
    </para>
    <para>
      &embecosm; does not sell the kits used on these courses. However the full
      specification of each kit is given on our website. This application note
      provides full details of how to construct each kit.

		First of all you need to solder on the 28 pin socket, this
		goes right in the middle of the board, once you have soldered
		it on you can insert the Atmega chip making sure the notches
		on the socket and on the chip are not pointing towards the
		pointy end of the chip.

              Next to solder is the 16MHz crystal, this is the next component
              along the board from the 10uf capacitor. sometimes it helps to
              put a small piece of cardboard underneath to ensure that the
              component does not touch the board.

		Now solder on three of the 100nf capacitors, these go in a row
		between the 22pf capacitors and the 28 pin socket and

            <entry>
              <para>
		The next component to solder on is the diode, if you hold your
		board pointy end down it goes on the left hand side of the 6mm
		tactile switch and 100nf capacitor, with the thick black
		stripe pointing upwards. The diode is one of the few
		components that you do need to get the correct way round.

              <para>
		Finally break the 40 pin header (using pliers or just snaping)
		into two sections of 16 pins and one section of six pins and
		you should have two spare pins left over.  The two 16 pin
		sections need soldering on the bottom of the board one either
		side of the 28 pin socket and chip, so that the pins are
		pointing down off the bottom of the board. The six pin section
		needs to be soldered right on the end of the board after the
		6mm tactile switch.
